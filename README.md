#Objective

The objective of this project was to identify a business case in which we can employ the Data Mining techniques learned throughout the course on a public dataset. Our group decided to focus on airline customer satisfaction levels as the airline industry has been struggling as of late as a result of the pandemic and ensuring customer satisfaction is more important than ever. Moreover, we wanted to identify which factors contribute most to a customerâ€™s satisfaction so that we can identify where airlines should be allocating their limited resources until demand once again picks up.
